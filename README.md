# SheCodesProjects
Greetings üëã

My name is Ainhoa and this repository will contain projects I've completed and am currently working on for my SheCodes Basic & FrontEnd Workshop lessons. After finishing my lessons with their respective projects, I will upload two links, one to the project and another to the official certificate of the course.
This is my first attempt at better documenting my progress and capturing lessons learned, so I ask that you be kind and keep in mind that I'm still learning üë©üèº‚ÄçüíªüòÄ.

## SheCodes Basic
For my first project in SheCodes, I build a website for book lovers‚ù§Ô∏è called *The Reading Loft*. Readers will find a small introduction to help them understand the website's purpose and how to navigate through it.

Built with HTML and CSS.
